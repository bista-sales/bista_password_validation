                Any system having a user login and password must have some methods
                to validate the authentication and accordingly grant access.
                Alternately it is very important to have a strong password in place
                to make this authentication secure. The use of strong passwords can
                many a times avoid or even prevent the attack on the system and thus
                ensure security of sensitive data.
                The Password Validation Module helps odoo systems to allow strong passwords
                for all their users
